# [RFOVE]()

This repository is used to build a Docker image of the RFOVE tool described in: <https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.imavis.2019.09.001>

> RFOVE is completely unsupervised, operates without any assumption or prior knowledge on the objectâ€™s shape and extends and improves the Decremental Ellipse Fitting Algorithm (DEFA). Both RFOVE and DEFA solve the multi-ellipse fitting problem by performing model selection that is guided by the minimization of the Akaike Information Criterion on a suitably defined shape complexity measure. However, in contrast to DEFA, RFOVE minimizes an objective function that allows for ellipses with higher degree of overlap and, thus, achieves better ellipse-based shape approximation.

The Docker image uses the [original implementation](https://de.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/74200-cell-segmentation-rfove-method). Also see [LICENSE](https://github.com/kostrykin/rfove/blob/master/rfove/LICENSE).

## [Docker instructions]()

Either build or pull the image:

- **Build image:** (only recommended for development)
  ```bash
  docker build --no-cache --tag kostrykin/rfove .
  ```
- **Pull image:** (recommended for production use)
  ```bash
  docker build --no-cache --tag kostrykin/rfove .
  ```

Run RFOVE:
```bash
docker run --rm -ti -v /tmp/io:/io kostrykin/rfove /rfove 250 0.1 0.2 201 /io/input.png /io/seg.tiff
```
In this example, the image `/tmp/io/input.png` is segmented and the results are written to `/tmp/io/seg.tiff`.
